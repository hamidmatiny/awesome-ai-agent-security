AI agents can read your email, run your tools, and act on your behalf. That power is also the attack surface. When an agent ingests untrusted text — a web page, a document, a tool's output, an MCP server's tool description — that text can become *instructions*. This list is a map of that problem space and how to defend against it.

Unlike a generic "LLM resources" dump, this list is **wedged on the agentic and MCP frontier**: tool poisoning, indirect injection through retrieved content, agent hijacking, data exfiltration, and confused-deputy attacks — the areas moving fastest and covered least.

## The core threat: the "lethal trifecta"

Simon Willison's framing is the mental model to internalize. An agent is dangerous to *you* when it combines all three:

1. **Access to private data** (your files, email, secrets)
2. **Exposure to untrusted content** (web pages, documents, tool outputs, other users)
3. **The ability to externally communicate** (send email, make requests, call tools)

Remove any one leg and exfiltration gets much harder. Most real-world incidents below are just this trifecta, exploited.
